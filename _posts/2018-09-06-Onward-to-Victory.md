    <td>Starting point:</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To get a functioning jekyll website working.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This week was quite easy so I didn't need to persevere through the "tough challenges" as we just sat down and listen to Mr. Keen. I am sure that this skill will be necessary further down the line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn’t ask any questions as there wasn't anything to question but I will need to question things as I will be trying to challenge myself in the future.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my blog by myself and didn’t need much help (except from google).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my old blog design and went for a much more muted web theme centered around few colours.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to Mr. Keen when he was talking and helped those around me when they needed help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I didn’t work on coding in my blog and didn’t challenge myself whilst working. I just tried to get little bits like my name on the blog and have not tried to do something I didn't do in years 7 or 8. I just changed the background.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Try to do something that will get me extra marks on presentation and technical abilities. I also want to keep a colour theme in my blog. But I really need to knuckle down and work on the blog while still helping people if they ask for help.</td>
